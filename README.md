Iâ€™m excited to share a project Iâ€™ve been working on: an AI-powered invoice processing pipeline using LLaMA 3.2 via Ollama! ðŸ’»

This agentic workflow automates the grunt work of invoice analysis, making life easier for HR teams. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Classify Client Tiers: Automatically sorts clients into Bronze, Silver, or Gold based on invoice totals (e.g., $4200 â†’ Gold).
Extract Key Details: Pulls client names, services, and payment terms from markdown invoices with precision.
Validate Totals: Ensures the total amount is accurate for downstream calculations.
Analyze Profitability: Calculates profit and margin (e.g., $3700 profit, 87.83% margin on a $4200 invoice).
Generate Summaries: Creates concise summaries for quick insights (e.g., "Invoice for ACME Corporation (Gold tier), totaling $4200, due within 30 days").
Built for scalability, and adheres to GDPR/SOC 2 standards. ðŸ“ˆ Itâ€™s a proof-of-concept showing how a single model (LLaMA 3.2) can orchestrate a full data processing workflow, from extraction to analysis.
